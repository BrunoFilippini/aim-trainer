##  About the game

This project is a game to train aim! As a shooting game enthusiast, I created this game to train and challenge myself, both in shooting games and everything I learned in two weeks of full-time Web Dev at IronHack bootcamp

## How it works?

Select your difficulty and fire!
Points vary depending on your accuracy so be careful you only have 3 attempts

## About Dev.

I'm a beginner in programming and I love technology and its possibilities
